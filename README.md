# Legacy Responsive Web Design By FreeCodeCamp - Randy Mej√≠a.

Responsive Web Design Repository, I'll be posting the first languages I've learned to build webpages as: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cscading Style Sheets) for design.

What am I going to build?

1- A cat phtoo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS.
2- Modern techniques like CSS Variables by building a penguin.
3- Practices for accessibility by building a web form.
4- Responsive Web Design to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes (Twitter Card with Flexbox & Complex blog layout with CSS Grid).
